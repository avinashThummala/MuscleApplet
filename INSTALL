For general notes read the README in the directory MCardApplet.

1. Programmes needed (for non Windows System use the corresponding versions):

	MCardApplet (already included in directory src)

	Some Java Card version meeting you Java Card smartcard requirements:
	
	Java Card 2.2   (for Giesecke & Devrient SmartCafe Expert 64)
		-> Example: java_card_kit-2_2_01-win-gl.zip
	Java Card 2.2.1  (for JCOP 41 v2.2)
		-> Example: java_card_kit-2_2_1-win-dom.zip
	Java Card 2.1.2 (for Cyberflex e-gate 32k)
		-> Example: java_card_kit-2_1_2-win.zip
	--> http://java.sun.com/products/javacard/

	For the Cyberflex you also need The CAP transformer (I believe this
	is a kind of obfuscator)
		-> place it under jc212\bin\
	--> http://www.trusted-logic.fr/down.php
		-> Example: captransf-1.5.zip

	Java Development Kits from Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE):
	J2SDK 1.3.0_05 (for Giesecke & Devrient SmartCafe Expert 64)
		-> Example: j2sdk-1_3_0_05-win.exe
	J2SDK 1.2.2    (for Cyberflex e-gate 32k)
		-> Example: jdk-1_2_2_017-windows-i586.exe
	--> http://java.sun.com/products/archive/index.html

	OBS: The version of the Java Card and Java Development Kit may be
	different, if you have another Java Card.

	Ant 1.5.4 (or above)
	Place in anywhere into you path or call it directly.

	cpp:
	Under Linux or some other Unix based system install the gcc suite or
	maybe it is already included in your distribution.
	Under Windows install the GNU C Compiler contained with Cygwin. Run
	the installer and select under Devel the gcc.
	The bin directory of Cygwin (e.g.: C:\cygwin\bin )must be included
	in the PATH environment variable.
	--> Available with Cygwin (http://cygwin.com/)

2. Compilation

	If you have a Giesecke & Devrient SmartCafe Expert 64, JCOP 41 v2.2
	or a Cyberflex e-gate 32k Java Cards and you obey the following
	structure and copy the apache-ant directory, the jaxp directory of
	the Java Web Services Developer Pack and other programmes like
	mentioned:

	depends\
		apache-ant
		jc212
		jc22
		jc221
		jdk1.2.2
		jdk1.3.0_05

	everything should work with the predefined Ant targets.

	OBS: Windows or Java does not like spaces in the pathname, 
	so you must place everything in a path with no spaces in the pathname.

	For the Giesecke & Devrient SmartCafe Expert 64, JCOP 41 v2.2 and
	the Cyberflex e-gate 32k Java Cards there are ready Ant targets in
	the build files build.xml:

		Cflex
		JCOP
		GD
		Custom

	Just run Ant with "ant <target>", e.g. "ant Cflex".

	The resulting files are located under MCardApplet/cflex,
	MCardApplet/jcop and MCardApplet/gd respectively.
	If you have another Java Card, you may have to change some settings
	and need other programs. At first give the Ant target "Custom" a
	try. If not you must tweak the settings in the Customs properties
	files.

3. Tweaking

	There are files Cflex.properties, JCOP.properties, GD.properties and
	Custom.properties in the root directory, which are mentioning the
	paths for the necessary programs. In files
	XYZCapabilities.properties you can define some parameters, e.g. with
	witch capabilities like RSA, DSA, DES, 3DES, encryption and signing
	capabilities the applet should be compiled in. What is possible
	depends on the abilities of your card!

	Further modifications for other cards should be done in the files
	Custom.properties or this files can be used as a template. If they
	are used as a template another Ant target must be created in the
	build.xml file.

4. Installation

	If you have compiled the applet you must install it on your card. 
	Use GPShell (http://sourceforge.net/projects/globalplatform) for it. 

	After the format command with MuscleTool your card is ready for
	applications.
