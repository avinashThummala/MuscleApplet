REQUIREMENTS
============================================================
In order to use this program, you must have a JavaCard 2.1.1
compliant smart card and a supported smart card reader.
You must also have all the software required to load a Java
Card Applet on your smartcard.
Different smart card vendors provide emulators for their own
smart cards. You can also try loading this program into an
emulated card. In this case you don't need cards nor readers
to be connected to your system.


DESCRIPTION
============================================================
This package contains precompiled binaries for the Card Edge
Applet, a free implementation of the Cryptographic Card Edge
Definition for Java Enabled Smartcards.

  http://www.musclecard.com/musclecard.html

Note that different versions of this Applet could be released,
with different features disabled, in order to let you save
space on the card if your application does not require those
features at all.


ADDITIONAL FEATURES
============================================================
This Applet actually supports some pin policy enforcement.
Checks are made on the pin size, character set and mix of
characters.
The exact pin policy depends on parameters provided at
instantiation time.


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
============================================================
This Applet has been tested with Schlumberger Cyberflex
Access 32K cards, and is known to work with most cryptographic
features involving RSA and DES keys. DSA testing still needs
to be done with cards supporting it.


KNOWN BUGS
============================================================
None at the moment (05-Oct-2001)


SUPPORT
============================================================
